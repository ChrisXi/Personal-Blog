/*Note*/
/*TreeSet: 
  TreeSet provides an implementation of the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. Objects are stored in sorted, ascending order.

  floor(): The floor(E e) method is used to return the greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.
  ceiling(): The floor(E e) method is used to return the smallest element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.
