  <div class="center"><em>Centered text.</em></div>  
  
  <div class="right"><em>Right-aligned text.</em></div>  
  
  <div class="justify"><em>Justified text.</em> Upon this a question  
  arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than  
  loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because  
  it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be  
  feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.  
  Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are  
  ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you  
  succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,  
  property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far  
  distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.</div>
